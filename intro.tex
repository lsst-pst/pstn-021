\section{Introduction}

%\note{See discussion on common material and timing considerations in \cite{PSTN-020}.}
%\note{This outline proceeds assuming this paper is being produced at the end of commissioning/early operations, and some form of routine alert production is happening in operations based on commissioning-derived or incremental templates.
%If only a small amount of LSSTCam commissioning data is available and is being released, only a minimal paper decribing the pipelines used to process that data would useful, and a more complete AP reference should come later.}
%\note{Information about the processing environment is presumed to be covered in \cite{PSTN-018}.
