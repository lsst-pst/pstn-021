%\note{following LDM-151}

\subsection{Single Frame Processing}

\note{Construction of calibration products assumed described in \cite{PSTN-026}.}

ISR, PSF and Background fitting, photometric and astrometric calibration.  Likely major commonalities with DRP.

\subsection{Template Generation}

\note{Pre-DR1 this may require description independent of DRP.}

High-level discussion of DCR correction could go here.

\subsection{Image Differencing}

\subsection{Source Detection and Measurement}

Including discussion of point source, dipole, and streak detection on difference images.  

\note{Algorithmic basics could be discussed elsewhere}

\subsection{Spuriousness scoring}

Algorithm, training, and performance of the ML spuriousness score

\subsection{Source Association}

Algorithms and interface considerations with the PPDB

\note{does \cite{PSTN-045} describe the APDB/PPDB implementation?}

\subsection{Alert Generation}

Formats \& contents

\subsection{Alert Distribution}

Mechanisms, connections to community brokers

\subsection{Alert Filtering Service}

\subsection{Forced Photometry}

\subsection{Source Injection}

\subsection{Metrics}
